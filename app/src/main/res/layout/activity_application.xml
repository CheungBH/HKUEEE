Once an application has been received, it will be reviewed by the programme directors. The application status and pending documents required will be highlighted in the online application status system (see below). Normally, applications in the main round will be processed in batches of every three weeks until the available quotas are filled to reduce processing delay. Therefore, applicants are urged to submit their applications together with the relevant documents at their earliest convenience. Normally, we shall only consider local applicants in the clearing round.\n
